📋 Request Management Project
This project was developed during my internship in the Technical Project Management department.
The goal is to create a web application where internal company requests can be managed in a more accessible, filterable, and visually simple way.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js

Backend: Node.js

Database: MSSQL

Design: Simple, modern, and color-coded user interface

📌 Project Features
1. Fully Integrated React and Node.js Structure
On the frontend, page transitions, form operations, and data displays were developed using React.

On the backend, REST APIs were written using Node.js. These APIs facilitate communication between the frontend and the database.

2. MSSQL-Based Data Management
Basic tables like Employees, Customers, and Requests were created.

Requests’ statuses, related employee and customer information are stored in the database.

3. Data Flow via API
The React application communicates with Node.js APIs via IP address to fetch or update data.

Devices connected to the same network can access this application.

4. User Interface and Design
A clean layout with no row borders in tables was preferred.

Request statuses are color-coded as follows:

Urgent: Red

Pending: Yellow

Resolved: Green

Filtering features: Requests can be filtered by status, employee, and customer.

5. Management Functions
Functions for adding, deleting, and editing requests.

Components for adding new companies and employees.

Listing and filtering all requests.

6. Local Network Access
The application was made accessible via IP on devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
